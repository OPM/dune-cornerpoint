/// \brief Partition a CpGrid using METIS
///
/// This function will extract graph information
/// from the grid, and the wells and use it to partition the grid.

/// @param grid The grid to partition
/// @param wells The wells of the eclipse If null wells will be neglected.
/// @param transmissibilities The transmissibilities associated with the
///             faces
/// @paramm cc  The MPI communicator to use for the partitioning.
///             The will be partitioned among the partiticipating processes.
/// @param edgeWeightMethod The method used to calculate the weights associated
///             with the edges of the graph (uniform, transmissibilities, log thereof)
/// @param root The process number that holds the global grid.
/// @param imbalanceTol Set the imbalance tolerance used by METIS, i.e. the entries of the parameter ubvec
/// @param allowDistributedWells Allow the perforation of a well to be distributed to the
///        interior region of multiple processes.
/// @return A tuple consisting of a vector that contains for each local cell of the original grid the
///         the number of the process that owns it after repartitioning,
///         a vector containing a pair of name  and a boolean indicating whether this well has
///         perforated cells local to the process of all wells,
///         vector containing information for each exported cell (global id
///         of cell, process id to send to, attribute there), a vector containing
///         information for each imported cell (global index, process id that sends, attribute here, local index
///         here), and a WellConnections object containing information about the well connections
///         (if argument wells was not null and this is the root rank this will contain connections in
///          form of global indices)
